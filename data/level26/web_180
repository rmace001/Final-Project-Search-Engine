          full-time MBA progra
         </a>
         m is a life-changing event. Many of us have been away from a formal academic environment (ex. Undergrad) for several years and had adjusted to life as a working adult. As we prepared to leave the working world to become students again, we did our due diligence and talked to current students, alumni, mentors, and sponsors about how to make the most of this experience and things to be mindful of once we arrived on campus. All of those conversations helped me to be ready for this Kelley journey, and I hope that my personal learnings and observations will be helpful to others.
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Plan to give yourself some time off before school starts.
          </strong>
          This was one thing that everybody told me when I was applying to school, but I seriously underestimated how much time I really needed. Many people recommend taking a vacation before school, but personally, I chose not to take any trips so I had time to spend with family and friends as well as time alone to relax. I only had two weeks off before school started—looking back—I wish I had given myself a month off. There isn’t a “one size fits all” answer to how you should spend the time so absolutely do whatever makes sense for you. If that means vacation, time alone, reading a book, visiting with family and friends or anything else—do that. Just make sure that you plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time to get all of those things done. Also, don’t forget to include the time you’ll need to move and get settled in your new place. Sufficient time to get these things done will allow you to begin business school relaxed, decompressed, and ready to take on the road ahead.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Save. Save. Save.
          </strong>
          Again, this is another one of those things that everybody told me the year or so before I started school, but I wish I had taken more seriously. Most people do not work during business school and have to rely on savings and financial aid for these two years. For me, it has been a huge adjustment to live without a steady income and it would probably be a little easier if I had been more diligent with saving while I was working. Don’t get me wrong, I did save, but looking back, I wish I saved even more. Maybe not taken a few of the trips I took before school and put that money aside to use now. 😊 You’ll still want to enjoy nights out, social activities, and the occasional reward for all your hard work while you’re in school so even when you think you’re saving enough, save a little more—you’ll thank yourself later!
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Give yourself the time and space to adjust once school starts.
          </strong>
          This is one thing that I don’t remember talking about before arriving on campus, but I think is super important. Whether you are coming from across the world or 30 minutes away, going back to school is a big life change. Many people are leaving lifelong friends, significant others, family, and the comfort of a familiar environment to come to a place that is brand new. You’re also getting back into an academic environment where the pace of things can be quite different from what you’re accustomed to. Everyone adjusts differently to change, so be honest with yourself about how and at what speed you adjust. Give yourself permission to feel whatever emotions you’re feeling during this time. If you’re nervous, excited, anxious, or even lonely—that is 100% ok. I felt a mixture of all the above when I first came to Bloomington, and it took the support of my loved ones, encouragement from my new friends, and my own self-assurance to get through. Know that you are not alone on this journey and there are so many people and resources to make sure you are successful here. Also, I can confidently tell you that you will get through it, and everything will be ok!
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         After reflecting on my first semester of business school, these are the top three things that I wish I had known (or taken more seriously) before beginning my Kelley journey. This experience has been more rewarding than I could have ever imagined. The
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/kelley-life/index.cshtml">
          Kelley family
         </a>
         is exactly that—a family. Having that support has been invaluable and business school would not be the same without it. I hope to continue having these amazing experiences, learning more and more and sharing my learnings to make the process a bit easier for others who are also beginning their journey!

         I’ve been thinking a lot about love lately. We all have loves, significant others, family and pets. When I packed everything and moved to

         </a>
         in July, I knew I liked the city. I had come to visit for my interview and had spent a few days here during Kelley Experience Weekend. Now, one semester later, I am officially ready to say the L-word to Bloomington. I love this city and am so happy with my choice to move my life to Bloomington for the

         Everyone, especially my classmates, are all the nicest people. We have been here to support each other through Core, recruiting, and everything in between. While everyone here is extremely hard working, they also know when to let loose and have fun.
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/academics/index.cshtml">
          Core
         </a>
         , the first semester of business school, is a challenging time. We are busy with school work,
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/careers/index.cshtml">
          recruiting
         </a>
         and trying to get to know each other. Luckily, we get to work with the same team of 5 people throughout the semester. On Halloween, my core team decided that it would be fun to “dress up” as power rangers to bring a little laughter to the day. Little things like this, make me love the city of Bloomington. I don’t know if it’s something in the water, or just the great job Kelley does recruiting, but my classmates make Bloomington a better place.

         </em>

         The
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/">
          full-time MBA program at the  Kelley School of Business
         </a>
         offers a unique learning experience called “
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/why-kelley/curriculum-experience.cshtml">
          The Core.
         </a>
         ” This 14-week intensive program is designed to give you an introduction to all the fundamental business concepts you’ll need to successfully navigate business school, your internship, and whatever career you choose after you leave Kelley. The Core is equal parts exciting, stressful, exhausting, and invigorating. Each incoming class is divided into three color-coordinated cohorts of around 60 students each and within that group of 60, you are placed on a smaller team of 4 or 5 people. You take all your classes with your cohort and do all your group projects with your smaller team.
        </p>
        <p>
         As my time in “The Core” ends I am struck not only by the number of valuable business skills my classmates and I have picked up, but even more so by how close we have all become. The Core has certainly given us a great business toolkit to carry with us as we head into our second year at Kelley and into our future careers, but I’ll argue that the most valuable item this part of the program provides is the relationships.

         When I started contemplating the idea of returning to school for an MBA and began to investigate different programs, I imagined how my life might look for those intense 22 months. As a father with three small kids I debated how my family and I would make it through the business school experience. After getting everyone on board with the idea of living the student lifestyle, we eventually found our way to
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/">
          Kelley
         </a>
         . While this MBA journey has been a roller coaster ride, it has also been full of lessons in time management, teamwork, and communication. I have found there are three keys to successfully navigate the business school road with a family.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Set Priorities and Find the Perfect Balance
         </strong>
         I learned from experience in my career that if you don’t stand up for your priorities no one else will. I entered school determined to find the perfect balance and give priority to what mattered most at the moment. It was the same routine every time a new class started, being assigned to a group and synchronizing schedules to find a time when we could get together. In those meetings, I shared that I wanted to work around being home for dinner and my kids’ bedtime and that I leave one day a week for family time. Everyone respected these priorities, and I learned that one day to catch up and bond with my family made those long weeks a little shorter and kept me motivated to get through them.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Help your Family and Classmates Get to Know Each Other
         </strong>
         During
         <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/academics/index.cshtml">
          Core
         </a>
         , I spent more time with the four other members of my core team than I did with my wife and kids. When I introduced my team to my family it made all the difference. My family better understood our goals as we moved through projects. The friendship that came from these interactions made both sides more understanding when extra time was required for an emergency at home or for late nights at school. Inviting my family to be engaged in what I was doing in school helped them to feel included in the business school experience.

          business school
         </a>
         to not only broaden my professional network but also broaden my friendships and personal connections. For some people, it can be daunting as an adult to make new friends, especially when you’re in an environment where you have the added pressures of academics and career planning. When you couple that with missing the comfort of friends and family back home, it can easily become more stressful. Despite those challenges, my time at Kelley has been filled with new experiences, new friendships, and great adventure. I want to share three things that have helped me during my time here at Kelley to live intentionally while pursuing my goal of making genuine friendships.

         Everyone tells you that the two years of b-school will go by quick, but you never realize how quickly until it’s over. Now, I am officially a

         student. It was like I blinked and all the late-night study sessions, interview prep, and international trips flashed before my eyes. I had a wonderful first year, and I learned a lot too. Here are the top 3 things that I took away from my first year of b-school—I hope they can help others navigate their MBA journey:

Yet, Kelley has all the resources you need and there is always a second-year student to go to for advice. You will never get this time back, so don’t be afraid—go for it.

         Having made it through one year of business school and almost a full 12-week internship, I have definitely learned and grown a lot since I stepped foot into Kelley last July. Hindsight is 20/20, but if I could look back and do it all over again there are a few things I wish I had known from the very beginning:

          Going back to school is tough.

         Attending lectures, late-night study sessions-take a little getting used to. Pick a study style that works for you early. Maybe you like to study in big groups. Maybe you don’t. There’s not a one-size-fits-all approach to studying; it’s going to take some trial and error to find what works for you. Don’t be worried when you don’t annihilate your first exam…or third. You may have been out of the classroom for a while, so be easy on yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rest assured though, there will come a time in your internship when you’re combing through data and something from class will click in your brain and help you solve the problem. That’s when you’ll realize it was all worth it.

         Year 1 is in the books and your mind has finally decompressed during your brief summer break. You said your goodbyes to classmates-now some of your closest friends-and finally re-enter the world of the employed, at least for the summer. By this point, you’re used to being flung into the unknown. How different could a new internship really be?

         I walked through the doors for Day 1 at 3M and felt a healthy balance of confidence and anxiety. I had binders full of frameworks and several consulting projects under my belt. I had also fallen on my face several times-oh, that Effective Communication class-and knew that I still had a long way to go.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the focus of MBA classes is equipping, the internship is the proving ground where the rubber meets the road. No more case studies. No more templates or projects nicely queued up. This is the real world with ambiguous projects and real opportunities to serve your clients and business partners.
        </p>
        <p>
         One month into my internship, I decided to take a step back and ask myself, “If you could talk to your pre-internship self, what advice would you give?”

         Last exam completed, the first year done… now what? The answer to this is straightforward – celebrate!  While this is probably the most obvious answer, the bigger question came next-how was I going to spend my few weeks before my internship started?  I wanted to make the most of it because my next break lasting this long might not come until retirement.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Catching up
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The time commitment required to succeed during my first year at the Kelley MBA program-at times-was quite overwhelming.  I made sure to prioritize school which led to some extracurriculars being put on the backburner. Catching up, for me, took on various forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Family, Friends, and Former Colleag
          </strong>
          ues – Balancing school with keeping in touch with family, friends, and former colleagues was a difficult task for me.  I wanted to make sure I caught up and connected with those important to me.  Building a network of supporters is great but maintaining these relationships is paramount.
