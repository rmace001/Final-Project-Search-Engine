     Timothy J. Moore,
     <i>
      The Meters of Roman Comedy
     </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
     This database is dedicated to the memory of Cesare Questa (1934-2016), the incomparable master of Roman Comedy’s
     <i>
      numeri innumeri,
     </i>
     without whom it would not have been possible.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
     This is a database of all metrical units (passages in an individual meter) in the extant plays of Plautus and Terence except for the fragmentary
     <i>
      Vidularia
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Each record represents a metrical unit, or a passage in a single meter (these range from one verse to over 200 verses), and includes the following fields:
    </p>
    <h4>
     <strong>
      Fields immediately visible in each record:
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <ul class="bulleted">
     <li>
      Playwright
     </li>
     <li>
      Play
     </li>
     <li>
      Starting Line: the number of the first verse of this metrical unit
     </li>
     <li>
      Ending Line: number of the last verse of this metrical unit
     </li>
     <li>
      Line Count: total number of verses in this metrical unit
     </li>
     <li>
      Starting Text: a quotation of the first verse in the passage
     </li>
     <li>
      Ending Text: a quotation of the last verse in the passage
     </li>
     <li>
      Meter: the meter of the passage (in the case of verses that include more than one meter, all are recorded as one: e.g.: ba2bacol counts as one meter, as does a versus reizianus and cr2tr4cat)
     </li>
     <li>
      Meter Before: the meter of the passage immediately preceding this one
     </li>
     <li>
      Meter After: the meter of the passage immediately following this one
     </li>
     <li>
      Character, Character Verses, Character Type: The name of each character who speaks or sings in the passage, the number of verses in which that character speaks or sings in the passage (in verses where one or more characters speak, one verse is attributed to each character, regardless of how much or how little of the verse that character delivers); and the character's type.
     </li>
     <li>
      Meter Type: the type of meter to which the meter of the passage belongs (if two or more meter types occur in the same verse, both are counted: e.g.: cr2tr4cat counts as both cretic and trochaic)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     <strong>
      Fields accessed by clicking “Notes” at the right of each record:
     </strong>
     (to hide the notes again, click on the box where they appear)
    </h4>
    <ul class="bulleted">
     <li>
      Closure: notes on how the passage ends (e.g., whether the end of the metrical unit corresponds with the end of a sentence or a scene)
     </li>
     <li>
      Comments on Length: remarks on such matters as numbers of long and short syllables, resolutions, and variations on standard metrical forms
     </li>
     <li>
      Comments, Other: notes on textual questions, content, choice of meter, and other matters.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
     How to Use the Database
    </h3>
    <ul class="bulleted">
     <li>
      Each of the following fields—“Playwright”, “Play”, “Character Type”, “Character”, “Meter”, “Meter Type”, “Meter Before”, and “Meter After”—comprises a dimension. Dimensions are listed on the left side of the database.  Each dimension includes two or more facets (e.g., the dimension “Playwright” includes the facets “ Plautus” and “Terence”).
     </li>
     <li>
      All the facets within a dimension can be viewed by clicking on the box with the dimension name. To hide the facets, click on the box again.
     </li>
     <li>
      Using the upper row of the database, with its “select all” and “deselect all” options, in combination with the list of dimensions on the left column, one can view and calculate various aspects of Plautus and Terence’s metrical practice together or separately.
     </li>
     <li>
      The same identical fields appear in each of the three pages of the database—“By Line,” “By Character Verse,” and “By Unit”—but the three pages calculate different things.
      <ul>
       <li>
        The page “By Line” calculates the total number of verses for each playwright, play, meter type, and meter.
       </li>
       <li>
        The page “By Character Verse” calculates the total number of character verses (parts or all of a verse delivered by any individual character) for each playwright, play, character type, character, meter type, and meter. Note that these numbers tend to be higher than the number of verses because characters often share verses. If two characters of the same type share a verse, two character verses are counted for the character type.
       </li>
       <li>
        The page “By Unit” calculates the total number of metrical units for each playwright, play, meter type, and meter, as well as how many times individual meters occur before and after metrical units.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Always begin by clicking “Select All” under “Dimensions” in the upper left corner of the page. This will make facets in all dimensions visible.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <h4>
     Viewing and Calculating
    </h4>
    <p>
     You can view Plautus and Terence’s metrical practice in its entirety, or all the passages in either playwright or any play, or the playwrights’ use of any individual meter or meter type, in any of the three pages.  In “By Character Verse,” you can also see the usage of meters by individual characters or character types, and in “By Unit,” you can also see what meters precede or follow other meters.
    </p>
    <h4>
     To view all the metrical changes in all of Plautus and Terence:
    </h4>
    <p>
     Begin by clicking “Select All” under “Dimensions” in the upper left corner of any of the three pages.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the metrical units will appear, listed by Plautus’ plays in alphabetical order followed by Terence’s play’s in alphabetical order. Note the page-changing controls at the upper right of the page, and click “Notes” to learn more details about each passage (after it has appeared, click the “Notes” box again when you want to hide it).
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are on the “By Line” page, you will be able to see how many total verses there are in each playwright, play, meter type, and meter by clicking on the appropriate box on the left of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are on the “By Character Verse” page, you be able to see how many character verses (part or all of a verse delivered by an individual character) there are in each playwright, play, meter type, and meter, and how many character verses each character type and character delivers, by clicking on the appropriate boxes on the left side of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are on the “By Unit” page, you will be able to see how many metrical units there are in each playwright, play, meter type, and meter, and how many times metrical units precede or follow each individual meter, by clicking on the appropriate boxes on the left side of the page.
    </p>
    <h4>
     To examine individual aspects of Plautus and Terence's metrical practice:
    </h4>
    <p>
     Begin by clicking “Select All” under “Dimensions” in the upper left corner of any of the three pages.
    </p>
    <p>
     By clicking “Deselect All” under a given dimension at the top of the page, and then choosing a facet of that dimension on the left of the page, you can examine individual aspects of Plautus and Terence’s metrical practice.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Example:
    </h4>
    <p>
     To study just the meters of Terence’s Adelphoe:
    </p>
    <p>
     Click “Select All” under “Dimensions” in the upper left corner of any of the three pages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Click “Deselect All” under “Play” at the top of the page, then click on the box “Play” in the left column.  A list of all Plautus and Terence’s plays will appear (plays are listed in alphabetical order).  Click on Adelphoe. All the metrical units of Adelphoe will appear. If you are interested in a specific passage in Adelphoe, you can scroll down to find it. Note the page-changing controls at the upper right of the page. Click “Notes” to learn more details about individual passages.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are on the “By Line” page, you can see the total number of verses in Adelphoe and the total number of verses in the play of each meter and meter type. If you are on the “By Character Verse” page, you can see how many character verses there are in Adelphoe, how many character verses are delivered by each character type and character in the play, and how many character verses in the play are in each meter type and meter. If you are on the “By Unit” page, you can see how many metrical units are in Adelphoe, how many units in the play are in each meter and meter type, and how many units in the play are preceded and followed by each meter.
    </p>
    <h4>
     To study aspects of Plautus and Terence’s metrical use in combination.
    </h4>
    <p>
     Successive uses of the “Deselect All” option in the dimensions at the top of the screen together with the boxes on the left of the screen allow the user to see how different aspects of Plautus and Terence’s metrical practice work together.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Examples:
    </h4>
    <p>
     To study anapestic verses delivered by meretrices in Plautus’ Bacchides:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
     <li>
      Choose the page “By Character Verse.”
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Select All” under “Dimensions” in the upper left corner of the page.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Deselect All” under “Character Type” at the top of the page.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click the “Character Type” box on the left of the page.  An alphabetical list of character types will appear.  Click “mer.” You will now see all the units in which meretrices deliver all or part of one or more verses.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Deselect All” under “Play” at the top of the page, then click on the box “Play” on the left of the page, and choose Bacchides from the alphabetical list.  The page now shows you all the metrical units in Bacchides in which meretrices deliver all or part of one or more verses and calculates how many character verses they deliver.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Deselect All” under “Meter Type” on the top of the page, then click on the “Meter Type” box on the left of the page.  Choose “an” from the alphabetical list of meter types.  The page now shows you only the metrical units in Bacchides in which one or more meretrices deliver part or all of one or more anapestic verses, and it calculates the number of anapestic character verses delivered by meretrices in Bacchides.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     To see how many times trochaic octonarii follow trochaic septenarii in Terence:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
     <li>
      Choose the page “By Unit.”
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Select All” under “Dimensions” in the upper left corner of the page.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Deselect All” under “Playwright” at the top of the page.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click the “Playwright” box on the left of the page and choose “Terence” from the alphabetical list. You will now see all the metrical units in Terence.
     </li>
     <li>
      Click “Deselect All” under “Meter” at the top of the page.
      <li>
       Click the “Meter” box on the left of the page, and choose “tr7” from the alphabetical list. The page now shows you all the units of trochaic septenarii in Terence.
      </li>
      <li>
       Click “Deselect All” under “Meter After” at the top of the page.
       <li>
        Click the “Meter After” box on the left of the page and choose “tr8” from the alphabetical list. The page now shows you only the metrical units in Terence in which a unit of trochaic septenarii is followed by one or more trochaic octonarii, and it calculates the number of times in Terence in which this occurs.

     Decisions I made regarding the authenticity of questioned verses are noted throughout the database in the “comments, other” field, accessed by clicking “Notes” in each record. Note in particular that I did not include
     <i>
      Stichus
     </i>
     48-57 or anything after verse 1331 of
     <i>
      Poenulus
     </i>
     (I believe both alternate endings are interpolations). I did not include the
     <i>
      Vidularia
     </i>
     or the fragments not attributed to extant plays, but I did include the fragments of
     <i>
      Amphitruo,
